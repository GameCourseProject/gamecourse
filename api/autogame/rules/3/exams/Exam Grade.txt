# Give exam grade if better than overall quiz grades

    when:
        logs = get_quiz_logs(target, "Exam")

        exam_grade = get_rating(logs)
        quizzes_grade = get_total_quiz_reward(target)
        rating = max(exam_grade - quizzes_grade, 0)

    then:
        award_exam_grade(target, "Exam", logs, rating)
