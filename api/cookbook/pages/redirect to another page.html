<p>You might want to redirect a user to some other page once he clicks on, for example, a button. To do this, we will
    make use of <span class="text-info">Events</span>, and the functions <span class="text-secondary">actions.goToPage</span>
    and <span class="text-secondary">pages.getPageByName</span>.</p><br>

<p>First of all, add a Button to your page. Go into its Edit modal, and scroll down until you find the <span class="text-info">Events</span>
    section. We will create a new event here. On the "When", choose "Click". On "Do", choose "actions.goToPage".</p><br>

<p>As for the expression, we can use a function as an argument to another one. In this case the full expression would be:</p>
<div class="bg-base-100 rounded-box p-4 my-2">
    <pre><code>{actions.goToPage(pages.getPageByName("Profile").id, %user)}</code></pre>
</div><br>

<p>The <span class="font-semibold">first argument</span> of actions.goToPage must be the id of the desired page. However,
this might be hard to know by heart, and that's why we used <span class="text-secondary">pages.getPageByName("Profile")</span>, to redirect
the user to the page named "Profile". Another advantage of this approach is, if for some reason that page is deleted but then a new one
with the same name is created to replace it, this will continue to work, even though the id changed. Don't forget that
<span class="text-secondary">pages.getPageByName("Profile")</span> returns the page, not the id! Thus the need for <span class="text-secondary">.id</span>.</p><br>

<p>The <span class="font-semibold">second argument</span> corresponds to who the page is about. It is optional, since this might not be relevant,
for example in pages with static content. However, in this specific case, it guarantees that clicking the button redirects the user to their own
Profile; since every user has this Profile page that is available for the others to see - meaning that you could also redirect to the Profile page
of another user, knowing their id.</p>
