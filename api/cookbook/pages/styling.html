<p>Although GameCourse comes with Components ready to be used style-wise, you can also customize them to your taste.</p><br>
<p>To do so, in the Pages editor, when you go into a Component's edit options, you have the <span class="text-secondary">Styling</span>
section available when you scroll down. In the field <span class="text-secondary">Style</span>, you can use <span class="text-info">CSS</span>.
To apply more than one style remember to separate them by ";"!</p><br>
<p>GameCourse also uses both <a class="link link-primary" href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</a>
    and <a class="link link-primary" href="https://daisyui.com/">DaisyUI</a>. In case you're not familiar with these,
Tailwind is a framework that allows styling without the need for CSS, by simply using class names. DaisyUI extends Tailwind. As such,
to use them in the editor, you can apply those classes in the <span class="text-secondary">Class</span> field.
As you would use them normally when coding, here you don't need to use any separator between several classes.</p><br>
<p>Tailwind has such a wide variety of class names that we can't describe them all here, and we highly suggest
checking out its documentation! But here's the gist of it...</p>
<ul class="list-disc ml-5 my-2">
    <li><span class="text-secondary">bg-*</span> changes the color of the background, if you replace * with one of the colors' names available in DaisyUI</li>
    <li><span class="text-secondary">text-*</span> similarly, changes the color of the text</li>
    <li><span class="text-secondary">font-bold</span> is self-explanatory. There's also thin, light, extrabold, etc.</li>
    <li><span class="text-secondary">w-*</span>, for example w-8, defines the width</li>
    <li><span class="text-secondary">h-*</span> defines the height</li>
    <li><span class="text-secondary">p-*</span> for padding, and <span class="text-secondary">m-*</span> for margin</li>
</ul>
