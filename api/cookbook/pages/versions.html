<p>Pages can look different depending on the role of who's viewing the page (<span class="text-secondary">viewer</span> role),
    or depending on the user whose information is being displayed in that page (<span class="text-secondary">user</span> role).</p><br>
<p>In the editor, you can create and manage these versions in the <b>dropdown menu at the actions bar</b>.</p><br>
<p>If you don't want to restrict a version to a specific role, use <b>none</b>.</p><br>
<p>Versions follow an <span class="text-info">hierarchy</span>, and the version displayed is always the most specific one. For example, in a Page with
versions:</p>
<ul class="list-disc ml-5 my-2">
    <li>Viewer: <span class="text-secondary">none</span>, User: none</li>
    <li>Viewer: <span class="text-secondary">Student</span>, User: none</li>
    <li>Viewer: <span class="text-secondary">Achiever</span>, User: none</li>
</ul>
<p>if the Viewer is an Achiever, the third version will be used.
If a Page doesn't have a specified version for the user's most specific role, then the nearest
ancestor will be used instead. In the above example, if the Achiever version didn't exist,
the Student one would be used, since Achiever is a subrole of Student.</p><br>

<p>While editing, if you make some change in the first version of the example above, it will be <span class="text-info">propagated</span> to the second,
since it is higher in the hierarchy. However, changes in the second won't affect the top one, but will affect the third. Changes in
the third aren't propagated since there isn't any version that is lower in the hierarchy.</p>
