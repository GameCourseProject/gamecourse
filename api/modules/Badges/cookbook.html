<p>This module allows you to create pages displaying the Badges configured for this course. Here's a general guideline on how to use it:</p><br>
<p>Create a new page with a block. Inside that block, create another one. You can then edit the inner one, to make it repeat for each of the badges!
To do this, use the expression</p>
<div class="bg-base-100 rounded-box p-4 my-2">
  <pre><code>{badges.getBadges()}</code></pre>
</div>
<p>in the field <span class="text-primary">"Repeat this component for every item in"</span>.</p><br>
<p>This repeats the block for each Badge, but how do you actually show information about each Badge now?</p>
<p>When using the Repetition field, the variable <span class="text-info">%item</span> becomes available for the component. We recommend also creating your own
  Auxiliary Variable, named <span class="text-secondary">badge</span>, with the value <span class="text-secondary">{%item}</span>, for clarity and to not create confusion
  if you ever decide to have a Repetition inside another Repetition. You will notice that, if you add components inside the repeated block, your custom variable will
  show up in the Inherited Variables section of those components.
</p><br>
<p>This means that you can now use the variable. For example, to show the name of the Badge, it's as simple as adding a Text component,
  with the following value in the text field:</p>
<div class="bg-base-100 rounded-box p-4 my-2">
  <pre><code>{%badge.name}</code></pre>
</div><br>
<p>Check out the manual to see the other attributes of a Badge!</p>
<br>
<p>It might be interesting to show, for example, which users have obtained level 1 of the Badge. To do so, we can use the same logic of creating a new component and
  filling its Repetition field, now with the expression
<div class="bg-base-100 rounded-box p-4 my-2">
  <pre><code>{badges.getUsersWithBadge(%badge.id, 1)}</code></pre>
</div>
