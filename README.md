GameCourse
=
Environment
---
Needs a server, for example, XAMPP, with a PHP 7.3 version, and a MySQL Database.

Login Applications
---
Users can log in with Fenix, Google, Facebook, or LinkedIn. To implement that mechanism, this is what needs to be done for each one:

**FÃ©nix:**
  1. Go to **Personal** &gt; **External Applications** &gt; **Manage Applications** (this last tab appears as **API Terms**, if no app was created previously).
  2. Click on **Create** to create a FenixEdu application
     - Define **Site** with the desired website URL where GameCourse will run, for example http://localhost/gamecourse/auth/ if running it locally.
     - Define **Redirect Url** as **&lt;base website url&gt;/auth/**, for example, http://localhost/gamecourse/auth/ if running it locally.
     - In **Scope**, select "Information".
  3. After its creation, it will appear in the applications list. In **Edit**, we have access to the **Client Id** and the **Client Secret**, which will be used in the next step.
  4. Go to *config.php*:
     - Set FENIX_CLIENT_ID to the **Client ID**.
     - Set FENIX_CLIENT_SECRET to the **Client Secret**.
     - Set FENIX_REDIRECT_URL to what was set in the Fenix application.

**Google:**
  1. Go to https://console.developers.google.com (it is necessary to have a google account to access it).
  2. Create a new project.
  3. Go to the **Consent screen** tab:
     - Select the "external" user type.
     - Fill mandatory fields and click on **Save and continue**.
  4. Go to the **Credentials** tab:
     - Add an **OAuth client ID** credential. 
     - Fill the mandatory fields and add the website where GameCourse will be run, appending "/auth?google" at the end, to **Authorized redirect URIs**. For example, http://localhost/gamecourse/auth?google if run locally.
     - After the app has been created, a modal is shown with the **Client Id** and the **Secret Key**, which will be used in the next step.
  5. Go to *config.php*:
     - Set GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID to the **Client ID**.
     - Set GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET to the **Client Key**.
     - Set GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URL to what was set in the Google application.   

**Facebook:**
  1. Go to https://developers.facebook.com/apps (it is necessary to have a Facebook account to access it).
  2. Click on **Create App** and select the option **Something Else**.
  3. Go to the **Dashboard** tab:
     - Add the product **Facebook Login**.
     - Write the website URL in the input shown, for example: http://localhost/gamecourse.
  4. Go to the **Settings &gt; Basic** tab:
     - Add the following domains to the field **App Domains**:  
       - The server that runs GameCourse, for example localhost
       - The website URL, for example localhost/gamecourse
       - The redirect URL, for example localhost/gamecourse/auth?facebook
     - In the same tab, we have access to **AppId** and to **AppSecret**, which will be used in the next step.
  5. Go to *config.php*:
     - Set FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID to the **AppId**.
     - Set FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET to the **AppSecret**.
     - Set FACEBOOK_REDIRECT_URL to what was set in the Facebook application.   
 
 **LinkedIn:**
  1. Go to https://www.linkedin.com/developers.
  2. Click on **Create App** (it is necessary to have a LinkedIn account to create an app):   
     - Set **App Name** to the application name. 
     - Below the **LinkedIn Page** field, click on **Create a new Login Page** and create a page.
     - Set **LinkedIn Page** to the URL of the created page.
     - Fill remaining mandatory fields and create the app.
  3. Go to the **Auth** tab: 
     - Save the **Client ID** and the **Client Secret**, because they will be used after.
     - In **OAuth 2.0 settings**, add the redirect URL, which is the website with "/auth?linkedin" appended at the end. For example: http://localhost/gamecourse/auth?linkedin.
  4. Go to the **Products** tab:     
     - Add the products: **Share on LinkedIn** and **Sign In with LinkedIn** (it takes a few minutes to be accepted).
  5. Go to *config.php*:
     - Set LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID to the **Client ID**.
     - Set LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET to the **Client Secret**.
     - Set LINKEDIN_REDIRECT_URL to what was set in the LinkedIn application.   
 

Setup GameCourse
---
1. If there is a file called *setup.done*, delete it.
2. Go to the GameCourse page, and then go to the **Courses** tab to create a course. Here are the multiple options:
   - Create a course manually, entering its details.
   - Copy an already existing course.
   - Import a zip with course(s) configurations (this needs to be in the correct format, which can be checked when exporting).
4. Go to the course that was created, and then to its **Settings** page to enable the desired modules, such as Views, XP and Levels, Skills, Profile, Leaderboard, and Badges.
5. There are many ways available to insert or update users:
   - To get students' information from Fenix, enable the **plugin** module, and in its configuration page, upload the .csv file get from Fenix with student's data from a specific course.
   - Users can be set in the **Users** tab, inside or outside a course, as desired.
   - GameCourse Users can be uploaded from a .csv with the following format: "name,email,nickname,studentNumber,isAdmin,isActive,username,auth".
   - Course Users can be uploaded from a .csv with the following format: "name,email,nickname,studentNumber,isAdmin,isActive,campus,roles,username,auth", where "roles" are separated by "-". 
6. Badges, Skills, and XP and Levels can be setup on their respective configuration page (those modules need to be enabled first). 
7. To update GameCourse, it is needed to set the configurations to access the external data sources: Moodle, Class Check, Google Sheets, and the QR source data.
   - In the plugin configuration page and QR page, respectively, set those configurations and set the periodicity desired to collect data from a source and insert students participation in the database. This can be changed or disabled at any time.  

Now the course is installed, and pages can be set up by editing views.

It is also possible to configure the course landing page, going to **Course Settings &gt; Roles**.


Changing the name of the platform
----
If you wish to have a name other than GameCourse:

1. Change name of the folder gamecourse.
2. Change BASE, FENIX_REDIRECT_URL, GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URL, FACEBOOL_REDIRECT_URL, and LINKEDIN_REDIRECT_URL in config.php.
3. Setup a fenix, google, facebook and linkedin application for the new url (instructions above in **Login Applications**).
4. Update the clients' id and secret according to the respective applications.
5. In *.htaccess* change RewriteRule so it has the new name instead of gamecourse.
