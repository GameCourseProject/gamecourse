There are podcasts of the most\nvaried types you can imagine, from a single guy ranting about a\nsubject to panel discussions to authors reading books. They often\ninclude theme songs, separators and audio special effects. Think of\nthem as modern day radio shows.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\nYou can tackle this task in two different ways:\n&lt;dl&gt;\n&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;A short story podcast: &lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;many\n  authors read their stories online in podcast format, a chapter a\n  week\n  (ex: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.podiobooks.com&quot;&gt;Podiobooks&lt;/a&gt;). Choose a\n  short story of your liking and record an episode where you read and\n  dramatize it. What's expected? A theme song, author intro before\n  starting the story (telling us about what is going to be read),\n  closing music, different voices for different characters and special\n  effects where relevant. For instance, if you read about a gun being\n  fired, it would be nice to hear the bang in the background (just\n  make sure it doesn't interfere with the understanding of the\n  narration).&lt;/dd&gt;\n&lt;/dl&gt;\n&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Show on a subject of your\n  interest&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Like scifi movies? Then make a show about\n  that. Comment on comic books. Discuss the latest android apps in the\n  market. Etc. The format is similar to that for a short story (intro,\n  effects, etc.) but you'll have to script it yourself instead of just\n  reading someone's tale aloud.\n&lt;/dd&gt;\n&lt;/dl&gt;\n\n&lt;/p&gt;\nWe expect something of around 3-5 min in length. You should attach to\nyour post the resulting mp3 file and the script (either written by you or\nthe short story you read). In the post include a short description of\nwhat you did. And, you know it: present original work, and we may ask for\n  improvements/changes before accepting the result, especially if the\n  quality or originality requirements aren't met.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n";}i:1;a:4:{s:4:"name";s:12:"Course Image";s:12:"dependencies";a:1:{i:0;a:2:{i:0;s:11:"Course Logo";i:1;s:5:"eBook";}}s:5:"color";s:7:"#006ac0";s:4:"page";s:2486:"\n&lt;p&gt;\nYou already created the logo in Course Logo.

They had\nto be copyied by hand, though, by copyist monks. This made books rare\nand expensive, but also lended them an importance and reverence they\ndon't have nowadays. It also created the opportunity to treat them as\nworks of art. Illuminated books are a great example of it. \n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p style=&quot;margin:auto; text-align:center;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;img style=&quot;width:300px;&quot; src=&quot;Illuminator/sample1.jpg&quot;&gt;\n&lt;img style=&quot;width:300px;&quot; src=&quot;Illuminator/sample2.jpg&quot;&gt;\n&lt;img style=&quot;width:300px;&quot; src=&quot;Illuminator/sample3.jpg&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\nYour goal here is to produce a single page of illuminated text. Choose\na text of your liking. Look for examples of illuminated manuscripts\nonline for inspiration. You should then produce the page, including,\nat least:\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Decorated initial capital. Lots of fonts can help here, such as\n  &lt;a href=&quot;http://fontforge.org/sfds/toyfonts.html&quot;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt;, but\n  plenty others as well&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Decorated borders and rules. These you should do in vector format\n  (SVG) and then included in the final result&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Relevant images / illustrations. Do keep in mind a photo or\n  similarly detailed image won't work (they didn't have cameras back\n  then). So, more abstracted images are better. You could go vector\n  or bitmap on this one&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There must be a coherence in style. An art nouveau illustrated\n  capital and a medieval border won't work. Having said this, you can\n  choose whatever style you wish (even futurist, if you keep in line\n  with the overall idea)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The graphic elements must bring the composition together. They\n  must complement each other and graphically they must be aligned,\n  interpenetrate, etc. Rule of thumb: if it looks just like a\n  copy&amp;amp;paste of separate elements next to each other, it won't\n  work. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;\nIn your post, include a pdf or image of the result. Inline display a\n  reduced size version, to facilitate recognition. Also, in your post,\n  describe the different elements you used, and the tools and\n  techniques employed.
