/**
 * This file is for styles that should override any view's inner views styles,
 * and don't make up a component variation.
 *
 * Examples :
 *  ✔  A table has text as headers, meaning view table has view text inside.
 *     We want to make header text red. Since this is not a variation of the
 *     view, we should add the styling to make it red in this file.
 *
 *  ❌ A view text can be a link. Since this is a variation of the view text
 *     we should add the styling for this directly in the view component styles.
 *
 *  ❌ We want to make leaderboard table have a red background. Since this is
 *     module specific styling it should be on the module styles folder.
