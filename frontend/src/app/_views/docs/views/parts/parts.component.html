      and can be reused. They can be created in two different ways, while editing a

      or by going to the view page in the settings and pressing ‘Create New
      Template’.</p>
    <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The templates can be used by copy, which
                    can be done in the same drop-down menu used to add a new part to a block. This
                    way the contents of the template are copied to the current view. </span></p>

    <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>They can also be used by reference by using
                    the ‘Add Template Reference’ drop-down menu. Templates by reference are
                    connected to the original template and any changes made to it will affect the
                    original.</span></p>
