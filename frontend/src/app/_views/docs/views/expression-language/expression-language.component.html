<div class="section">
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>GameCourse has its own language and
                vocabulary to allow users to personalize views and interact with the database,
                this is used in the settings of the individual view parts. It is very similar
                to a programming language. The language has multiple libraries, some of which
                only became available with the activation of specific modules, the functions
                defined in those libraries can return values, objects (a data structure
                containing values) and collections (a data structure containing any number of
                objects).</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><span>An example of an expression is </span><code>Hello
    {{'{users.getUser(%viewer).name'}}!</code><span> which would be evaluated as ’Hello John!’,
                    for example, if the name of the user was John. In this language anything typed
                    outside of the curly brackets is accepted as text with the exception of names
                    starting with </span><code>%</code><span> (percentage) which return the value of a variable, to
                    escape this case use
                </span><code>%%</code><span>. When you want to evaluate something, it should be placed inside curly
                    brackets, for example, </span><code>{{'{2*3}'}}</code><span>. To access the name of the user as we
                    demonstrated in the first example, we use </span><code>{{'{users.getUser(%viewer).name}'}}</code>
                <span>which will fetch the user with the id </span><code>%viewer</code><span> (which is evaluated as the
                    id of the user that is logged in the application) and then returns the name of
                    that user.</span></span></p>
  <h2>Operations and Functions</h2>
  <div class="subsection">
    <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>
                    <span>As in many other languages the expressions provide the simple mathematics operators for
                        addition </span><code>+</code><span>, subtraction </span><code>-</code><span>, multiplication
                    </span><code>*</code>
                    <span>, division </span><code>/</code><span> and mod </span><code>%</code>
                    <span>. It also provides logic and bitwise operators, and </span><code>&amp;&amp;</code><span>
                        (bitwise </span><code>&amp;</code><span>), or </span><code>||</code>
                    <span>(bitwise </span><code>|</code><span>), negation </span><code>!</code><span> (bitwise
                    </span></span>
      <code><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Cambria Math",serif'>&#8764;</span></code>
      <span lang=EN-US>)and bitwise xor </span><code><span lang=EN-US>ˆ</span></code>
      <span lang=EN-US><span>. It is
                        also possible to call functions defined in GameCourse from the expressions. A
                        function call starts with the library that provides that behavior or a
                        collection/object belonging to one of those libraries and is followed by a dot
                    </span><code>.</code><span> and an arbitrary number of letters, A through z. Arguments of the
                        function are enclosed in parenthesis </span><code>()</code><span> and need to be comma
                    </span><code>,</code>
                    <span>separated, if there are no arguments the parenthesis are not necessary.</span></span>
    </p>
    <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The libraries available by default are
                    system are actions, awards, allCourses, participations, system and users. There
                    are also some functions not associated with any library that can be used over
                    objects or collections.</span></p>

    <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>There are also 3 other libraries which can
                    be available if their respective modules are enabled, which are badges,
                    skillTrees and xp. </span></p>

    <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Other functions may be added by registering
                    them in a module.</span></p>
    <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><span>The available functions according to the
                        enabled modules can be found in the </span><a [routerLink]="'/docs/functions'">Functions page</a>.</span></p>

  <h2>Variables</h2>
  <div class="subsection">
    <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><span>Variables are used by the expressions to
                        allow an easier creation of expressions without having to write very long
                        expressions to access certain fields. A variable starts with a % (percentage
                        symbol) and is followed by an arbitrary number of letters, A through z. It is
                        possible to call functions over variables, for example is we have a variable
                    </span><b>%item</b><span>
                        containing an user object we can call functions of the users library such as
                    </span><b>%item.username</b>.</span></p>

    <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>GameCourse has already defined some
                    built-in meta variables:</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>%course</code><span> - Represents the course that the
                        user is manipulating;</span></li>
      <li><code>%user</code><span> - Represents the user associated to
                        the page which is being displayed;</span></li>
      <li><code>%viewer</code><span> - Represents the user that is
                        currently logged in watching the page;</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>And when the Loop Data field is used there
                    is also:</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>%index</code><span> - Represents the current index while
                        iterating a collection;</span></li>
      <li><code> %item</code><span> - Represents the object that is
                        currently being iterated in that view;</span></li>
    </ul>
