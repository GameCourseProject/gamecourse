  <h1>Modules</h1>
  <p>GameCourse is implemented modularly. This means that you can pick and choose which parts you want to enable for each course. They are categorized into Data Sources, Game Elements, and Tools.</p>
  <p>
    <b>Data Sources</b> are used to import data into the system. For instance, you can import studentâ€™s participations from Moodle and then use that data here.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Game Elements</b> vary from XP, to Badges, Skill Tree, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Tools</b> offer varied functionality. For instance, the QR module lets professors generate codes to give to students who participated in class. The Profiling module enables an algorithm that categorizes students according to their XP accumulation profile and can be then used for adaptation strategies.
  </p>
  <p>To configure the ones enabled in a course, enter the course from the main GameCourse page and then go into "Modules" from the sidebar. Clicking on a module will give you the option to enable, disable, and in some cases to configure it. Keep in mind that some modules have dependencies, so you might need to enable other modules first.</p>
