  <h1>Modules</h1>
  <p>GameCourse is implemented modularly. This means that you can pick and choose which parts you want to enable for each course. They are categorized into Data Sources, Game Elements, and Tools.</p>
  <p>
    <b>Data Sources</b> are used to import data into the system. For instance, you can import studentâ€™s participations from Moodle and then use that data here.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Game Elements</b> vary from XP, to Badges, Skill Tree, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Tools</b> offer varied functionality. For instance, the QR module lets professors generate codes to give to students who participated in class. The Profiling module enables an algorithm that categorizes students according to their XP accumulation profile and can be then used for adaptation strategies.
