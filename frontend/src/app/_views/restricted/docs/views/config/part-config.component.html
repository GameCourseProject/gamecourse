  <div class="subsection">
    <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><span>This field is used to get data from the
                        database that will be accessible with the %item variable. If the expression
                        produces a collection, then it will be looped through. The objects provided by

  <h2><span lang=EN-US>Variables</span></h2>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>This section allows for the creation of new

                expression for its value. To delete a variable, press the ‘Remove’ button. The
                variables can be used in the current view part and any of its children.</span></p>
  <h3>Example</h3>
  <div class="subsection">

  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In the other types of view parts this
                section has the Expression that defines what is showed by that part. There is

  <h3>Example</h3>
  <div class="subsection">
    <p>For example, if %user was 10000 and %userData was the user object for that %user who's name was "Example
      Name": </p>

                ‘Visible by condition’ – the element id only rendered if the condition
