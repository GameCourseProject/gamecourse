<div class="prose w-full">
  <h1>View Editor</h1>
  <p>Students inside a course will only see the pages that are configured by the professors on "Pages". These consist of <b>Views</b>, that can be created and edited. You can have multiple drafts of pages, since only the ones configured as <b>Visible</b> will be accessible.</p>
  <p>Once you click in Edit for an existing page or Create a new one, you will be redirected to the editor. Its interface lets you completely customize the content and appearance of the pages. This way you can create pages as simple as static ones, or use the Expression Language to display dynamic content retrieved from the Modules.</p>
